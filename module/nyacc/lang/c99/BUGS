BUGs and TODOs

C99-010	<= next id

C99-009	18 Mar 2017, M.Wette
	pprint generates two spaces in declarations e.g.,
	int foo(int  x);

C99-008	02 Mar 2017, M.Wette
	clean up error traps among raw-parser run-parse and parse-c99[x]

C99-007	16 Feb 2017, M.Wette
	cpp.scm: does __LINE__ get expanded?

C99-005	26 Jun 2016, M.Wette
	in util2.scm, tree->udecl needs to return "struct" and "union"
	entries for stuff like
		struct foo { int x; };

C99-004	xdef arg to gen-c-lexer may be too simple
	it is currently a predicate.  Maybe it should return three values
	#f => don't expand
	#t => expand
	string => use string

C99-003 util2.scm/tree->udict should return declarations in order

=== RESOLVED ===================

C99-001	cpp breaks on the following, I think:
	#define ABC 123 /* this is a var */
	#if ABC > 100
	# error "bla"
	#endif
13Apr16	works

C99-002 CPP redesign is not working for ifdef and defined:
	#define A 1
	#ifdef A
	...
	breaks because it gets expanded as (if "defined(1)")
	see cppbody.scm, near line 133:
	     ((read-c-ident ch) =>
	      (lambda (iden)
25Jun16 fixed

C99-006	06 Aug 2016, M.Wette
        code "val = '\0';" gets pprinted to "val = '^@;';"
02Mar17	fixed, V0.76.5+c99dev
