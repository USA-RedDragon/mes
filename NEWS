* Changes in 0.4 since 0.3
** Core
*** Smaller C-reader
The C-reader needs only support reading of words and lists
(s-expressions), line-comments.  Quoting, characters, strings,
block-comments are all handled by the Scheme reader later.
** Language
*** Keywords are supported.
*** Cond now supports =>.
*** Lambda* and define* are now supported.
*** #;-comment is now supported.
*** Non-nested #| |#-comment is now supported.
** Noteworthy bug fixes
*** Closure is not a pair.
* Changes in 0.3 since 0.2
** Core
*** Number-based rather than pointer-based cells.
*** Garbage collector aka Jam scraper.
A variant on SICP's stop and copy Garbage Colletor (Jam Scraper?)
algorithm has been implemented.
*** The reader has been moved to Scheme.
** Language
*** Simple loadable modules.
*** Srfi-9 and match use handwritten syntax-rules (mes-use-module (mes syntax)).
*** Optional syntax-case using psyntax (mes-use-module (mes psyntax)).
** Noteworthy bug fixes
*** Srfi-0 has been fixed.
* Changes in 0.2 since 0.1
** Core
*** Names of symbols and strings are list of characters [WAS: c-string].
*** Sc-expand from pre-R6RS's psyntax has been integrated.
*** Undefined variable error now shows the name of the undefined variable.
*** There is now only one SCM type for builtin functions.
*** Macro expansion has been cleaned-up.
** Language
*** Mes now provides a subset of R6RS.
*** Mes now provides syntax-case.
*** Mes now provides `load'.
** Noteworthy bug fixes
*** Using values as second parameter of builtin function yields first value.
*** Quoted internals (e.g. 'if 'lambda) are now symbols.
*** Syntax error now exits.
*** Make+Bash voodoo has been replaced by build-aux/mes-snarf.scm.
*** Apply now accepts multiple list arguments.
*** Apply of character, inernal, number, string is an error.
*** Quasisyntax reading 

* Changes in 0.1 (since progress report #2)
** Core
*** expand_macro is now a separate function.
*** A smaller core can now compiled using BOOT=1.
The smaller core does not provide define, define-macro, or quasiquote;
these are provided from a Scheme version of implemented eval/apply.
** Language
*** Mes now provides a subset of R5RS.
*** Mes now provides let-syntax.
*** Mes now provides match.
*** Mes now provides quasisyntax, unsyntax and unsyntax-splicing.
** User interface
*** Mes now provides a REPL, run:
    scripts/repl.mes
*** Mes compiler can be run as a script:
    scripts/mescc.mes doc/examples/main.c
*** Macro expansion can be inspected in the REPL, e.g.:
    ,expand (and 0 1)
** Noteworthy bug fixes
*** Performance: scripts/mescc.mes now takes 2s to compile main.c (was 1'20").
*** Symbols are now truly unique.
  * '(), #t, #f are no longer symbols.
