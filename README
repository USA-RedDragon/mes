Mes -- Maxwell Equations of Software

Mes aims to create an entirely source-based bootstrapping path.  The
target is to [have GuixSD] boostrap from a minimal, easily inspectable
binary --that should be readable as source-- into something close to
R6RS Scheme.

As bootstrapping is presumably easiest and probably most fun with
Scheme, the next step for Mes is mescc: a C compiler/linker to
boostrap into GNU Gcc and GNU Guile, possibly via Tiny-CC.

It currently has an interpreter written in C (mes) with Garbage
Collector (Jam Scraper), a library of loadable Scheme modules with
test suite just barely enough to support a simple REPL (repl.mes) and
a proof-of-concept c-compiler (mescc.mes) that produces an elf from
the simplest of C files.

Mes is inspired by The Maxwell Equations of Software: [[http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%25201.5%2520Programmers%2520Manual.pdf][LISP-1.5]] -- John
McCarthy page 13.

Mes is free software, it is distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public Licence version 3 or later.  See the file COPYING.
