	* lang/c99/body.scm: added 'skip state so that if skipping #if
	then no CPP if or elif arguments are evaluated

	* lang/c99/cpp.scm: parse 0L numbers, convert c numbers (e.g.,
	123L) to scheme so that string->number works.  I need to update
	cnumstr->snumstr in nyacc/lex.scm.

2017-02-16  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/c99/cpp.scm (rtokl->string): now handled symb ## arg ## symb
	(scan-cpp-input): skip-il-ws after #\(

	* ../../test-suite/nyacc/lang/c99/exam.d/ex05.c: C99 does not
	allow lone `;' outside of functions.  Removed.

2017-01-07  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/c99/body.scm (read-cpp-line): cpp statement should not
	include newline?  Changed to unread final newline.

	* lang/util.scm: add report-error: prints msg w/ file, line

	* parse.scm (make-lalr-parser): changed printout of parse error to
	(throw 'parse-error . args) and expect the full parser to catch
	the error

	* lang/c99/mach.scm (c99-spec): from
        2017-01-07 Jan Nieuwenhuizen  <janneke@gnu.org>
	mising unquote in output sx for goto: `(goto $2) => `(goto ,$2)

2017-01-06  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/c99/parser.scm: default parser #:mode is now 'code; done
	since the CPP should now be working (??)

	* lalr.scm (process-spec): in add-el changed memq to member since
	we are using strings for terminals

2017-01-02  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lang/c99/mach.scm (c99-spec): added hooks (cpp-ok!, no-cpp!) to

	* bison.scm: new file providing make-lalr-machin/bison.  It is
	similar to make-lalr-machine but uses external bison program
	instead of the default from-scratch lalr code.

2016-03-04  Matt Wette  <mwette@alumni.caltech.edu>

	* lalr.scm: changed grammar parser to interpret $string as
