Building and Installing Mes

* Get it

   git clone https://gitlab.com/janneke/mes

* Prerequisites

** A C compiler, GNU Gcc 4.9.3 is known to work.
The idea is to drop this requirement, of course.

** Guile, version 2.0.12 or is know to work.
Guile is not strictly necessary but it is used by the configure script
and in development.

** GNU Make, version 4.0 is know to work.
Not strictly necessary.

** /bin/sh, GNU Bash 4.3 is known to work.
Let's just say for now that it gets awkward without a shell.


*** Development (but see [[./guix.scm]])

** GNU coreutils
** sed, GNU sed 4.2 is known to work.
** git, 2.10 is known to work.
** Perl, 5.22 is known to work.

   ./configure
   make all
