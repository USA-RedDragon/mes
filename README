Mes -- Maxwell Equations of Software

Mes is inspired by The Maxwell Equations of Software -- John McCarthy page 13
http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/LISP%201.5%20Programmers%20Manual.pdf

Its aim is to have GuixSD boostrap from a minimal trusted binary into
Scheme.  The strategy is to use OrianJs self-hosting hex assembler to
write a minimal LISP called MES to bootstrap a full fledged Scheme,
written in MES.

Mes is free software, it is distributed unde the terms of the GNU
General Public Licence version 3 or later.  See the file COPYING.

Current targets.

* make check

* C compiler

   make mescc
   make guile-mescc

from there, work on mescc.scm, main.c.

* Transition to syntax-if.scm (still using syntax-cond.scm)

* syntax-case using portable psyntax.pp

   make psyntax

* syntax-case using define-macro

   make syntax-case
   make guile-syntax-case

* PEG

   make peg
   make guile-peg
