Mes is inspired by The Maxwell Equations of Software -- John McCarthy page 13

Its aim is to have GuixSD boostrap from a minimal trusted binary into
Scheme.  The strategy is to use OrianJs self-hosting hex assembler to
write a minimal LISP called MES to bootstrap a full fledged Scheme,
written in MES.
