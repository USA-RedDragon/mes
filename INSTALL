** Development
For development, there are some more dependencies.
*** Guix

**** [[https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/nyacc][Nyacc]], 0.82.4 is known to work.
**** GNU Gcc, 4.9.3 is known to work.
The idea is to drop this requirement, of course.

Guile is not strictly necessary but it is used by the configure script
and in development.

Let's just say for now that it gets awkward without a shell.
